## 💻 Development

### Using Make Commands

The project includes a Makefile with various commands to manage the development environment:

```bash
make dev          # Start all services in development mode
make build        # Build all services
make start        # Start all services
make start-d      # Start all services in detached mode
make stop         # Stop all services
make restart      # Restart all services
make logs         # Show logs from all services
make clean        # Clean up Docker environment

# Service-specific logs
